Hello madam,

This is Mukund Kumar,I would like to thank you for the invaluable oppertunity you provided to me to work as intern in Lead Semantics pvt. lmt. 


When I began this internship, I had very little idea how to go about it – or especially, how to network to discover new job opportunities. The information and advice you gave (and, in particular, the list of contacts you shared with me) made all the difference in helping me to focus my job search.

During the internship,i have learned javascript ,nodejs and allegrograph database and sparql query language for the working with the graph database.Inspite of all,one more important thing i have learned is how to get into make themself comfortable new technologies.This give me confidence to work in any area as per require.

I’m happy that i have completed my internship with a great exprience Again, thank you so very much. I greatly appreciate your generosity.

Sincerely,

Mukund Kumar
